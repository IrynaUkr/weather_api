## Project Update
21 March(Tue) Anthony

Added repository interface and class. 
Added a table AdviceRule in Model class, to persist rules for weather advice.
There is now a method generateAdvice(weather) which loops through AdviceRule table and constructs the advice.
We can run the test case in WeatherManagerServiceTests to test the getCurrent weather and generate advice. 
At moment, h2 database is used. Will use postgres DB.

New model classes added - Advice for the advice object, and ??ManagerReponse for our API response body.
When WeatherManager receives REST API get request for a city, the controller can call Service class methods to fetch weather object and advice object, 
to insert to ManagerResponse?? Object to form the ResponseEntity.* Please ignore ManagerResponse for now (Tuesday), I cannot get it working. use advice class for responseEntity is fine.
